<!-- steps for the recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.
                <ul>
                    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                    <li>8 oz Linguine Pasta</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter, and add olive oil. Cook the shrimp for a minute, then season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay Seasoning or paprika if using.
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
                    <li>1 lb Shrimp</li>
                    <li>½ tsp Salt</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp Black Pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp Old Bay Seasoning</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Continue to cook the shrimp until it's pink. Do this in batches if you're worried that you may overcook the shrimp. Remove the shrimp onto a plate and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>In the same pan, melt butter and add garlic, cook for 30 seconds or until it's fragrant. Add the heavy cream, and with the spatula deglaze the pan.
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
                    <li>1 clove Garlic, Minced</li>
                    <li>½ cup Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Add parmesan, let it melt then loosen the sauce with reserved pasta water and allow to simmer for a minute. Taste the sauce and see if more salt and pepper is needed.
                <ul>
                    <li>½ cup Parmesan</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Toss the pasta with the sauce until it's well coated. Add the shrimp back in to reheat it gently, garnish with freshly chopped parsley and serve.
                <ul>
                    <li>¼ cup Fresh Parsley</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
